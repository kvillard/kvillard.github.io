    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Kenneth Villard, and I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Miami, 
        where I'm pursuing a major in Computer Science alongside a minor in Economics. 
        Originally hailing from Stamford, Connecticut, my journey in the world of 
        technology has been fueled by a passion for innovation and problem-solving.

        I'm on the lookout for opportunities to dive into the realms of software development, 
        artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. My goal is to not just expand my theoretical 
        knowledge but to gain hands-on experience that sharpens my skills and understanding of 
        computer science.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>BA in Computer Science (2022 - present), I gain expertise in software development,
            covering problem-solving, programming,and hardware comprehension. The 
            program prepares me for careers in tech and related industries through instruction,
            projects, and collaboration.</p>

        <p>Minor in Political Economy (2022 - present),The Minor in Political Economy equips me
            with solid analytical tools supporting critical thinking to address economic problems. 
            I gain the ability to comprehend major economic trends and apply economic theories
            to analyze specific fields. </p>
