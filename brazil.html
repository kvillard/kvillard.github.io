        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule, Brazil gained its independence in 1822, 
            maintaining a monarchical system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent 
            proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889. Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the 
            country until populist leader Getúlio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. VARGAS governed over various versions of 
            democratic and authoritarian regimes from 1930 to 1945.<p>
        </p>Democratic rule returned (including a democratically 
            elected VARGAS administration from 1951 to 1955) and lasted until 1964, when the military overthrew President João GOULART. 
            The military regime censored journalists and repressed and tortured dissidents in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
            The dictatorship lasted until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers, 
            and the Brazilian Congress passed its current constitution in 1989.</p>
        <p>By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural
            growth and development of its interior. Having successfully weathered a period of global financial difficulty in 
            the late 20th century, under President Luiz Inácio LULA da Silva (2003-2010) Brazil was seen as one of the world's 
            strongest emerging markets and a contributor to global growth.</p>

        <h3>Demographic Info</h3>
        <p>Brazil's rapid fertility decline since the 1960s is the main factor behind the country's slowing population growth 
            rate, aging population, and fast-paced demographic transition. Brasilia has not taken full advantage of its large 
            working-age population to develop its human capital and strengthen its social and economic institutions but is funding 
            a study abroad program to bring advanced skills back to the country. The current favorable age structure will begin to 
            shift around 2025, with the labor force shrinking and the elderly starting to compose an increasing share of the total 
            population. Well-funded public pensions have nearly wiped out poverty among the elderly, and Bolsa Familia and other social 
            programs have lifted tens of millions out of poverty. More than half of Brazil's population is considered middle class, 
            but poverty and income inequality levels remain high; the Northeast, North, and Center-West, women, and black, mixed race, 
            and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. Disparities in opportunities foster social exclusion and 
            contribute to Brazil's high crime rate, particularly violent crime in cities and favelas (slums)..</p>
